# snapchat_login_attemptor
A command-line application built with Python that is intended to evaluate the security of Snapchat accounts.  The software takes a user-provided wordlist and a target username as input, then uses each password in the wordlist to try to log in to the designated account in a methodical manner.


# snapchat_login_attemptor

    A straightforward Python script that uses a given wordlist to try to get into Snapchat using a brute-force method.

 **Warning:**  This tool is only meant to be used on accounts you have specific authorization to test for security and educational purposes.  Unauthorized use of it against accounts is unethical and may be against the law.  Any misuse of this tool is not the responsibility of the developers.

 ## Overview

 The Python command-line utility `snapchat_login_attemptor` accepts as inputs a text file with a list of possible passwords (wordlist) and a Snapchat username.  The script then repeatedly goes through the wordlist, trying to use each password to login with Snapchat.

**Please use this tool responsibly and ethically.**

## Features

* Attempts to log in to a specified Snapchat account.
* Utilizes a user-provided wordlist for password attempts.
* Provides basic output indicating login attempts and success (if any).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* The `requests` library for making HTTP requests. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrsoni020/snapchat_login_attemptor
    cd snapchat_login_attemptor
    ```

2.  **Prepare a wordlist:** Create a text file (e.g., `passwords.txt`) where each line contains a potential password.

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python snapchat_login_attemptor.py <username> <wordlist_file>
    ```
    Replace `<username>` with the target Snapchat username and `<wordlist_file>` with the path to your wordlist file.

## Important Notes

* Snapchat has security measures in place to prevent brute-force attacks, such as rate limiting and account lockout after multiple failed attempts. This script might not be effective against accounts with strong, unique passwords or those protected by such measures.
* The success rate of this tool heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the provided wordlist.
* Be aware of and comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the use of such tools.
